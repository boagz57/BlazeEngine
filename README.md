# Test Engine1 - Called it BlazeEngine

After spending a lot of time learning C++ I created my first toy project for experimenting with different ideas in game development. All this program does is generate different shapes (just squares and triangles) that move and collide with one another. There is also utilization of a sound library which produces sounds upon collision. Really just getting my feet wet here and attempting to understand how a game or game eninge project might be constructed. This project uses more traditional oop techniques with many class structures, inheritance heirachies, etc. I also tried experimenting with testing using google test. The project is separated into two parts, the game.exe and an engine.lib which is statically linked to the game.exe.
