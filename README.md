# BlazeEngine

This was my first toy project for experimenting with different ideas in game development. Really just getting my feet wet here and attempting to understand how a game project might be constructed. This project uses more traditional oop techniques with many class structures, inheritance heirachies, etc. I've also tried experimenting with testing using google test. It's separated into two parts, the game.exe and an engine.lib which is statically linked to the game.exe.
