# Test Engine1 - Called it BlazeEngine

This was my first C++ toy project for experimenting with different ideas in game development. Really just getting my feet wet here and attempting to understand how a game or game eninge project might be constructed. This project uses more traditional oop techniques with many class structures, inheritance heirachies, etc. I also tried experimenting with testing using google test. The project is separated into two parts, the game.exe and an engine.lib which is statically linked to the game.exe.
